# AP.UDTChatService

This is a multi-month individual project that I developed during 
one of my classes at Georgia Tech. 

This is a C++ developed, locally hosted, UDT chat server. The attached file 
"CS3251_PA1_Readme.pdf" has more in-depth explanations. 

To Run: 

~:$ ./chatserver -port 5001 -passcode <passcode>

~:$ ./chatclient -join -host <hostname> -username <username> -passcode <passcode> -port 5001
